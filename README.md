# greetings!

hi, i'm tilda, and welcome to my github profile! whether you're curious about me or just looking to get in touch, i've got you covered!

# about me

i'm a pretty young person who has been fascinated with computers and how they work from a young age. to the point where i have learned myself multiple programming languages including python and javascript, for backend and frontend usages. i take things as they come, and spend way too much time on projects to get things done.

# what have i done?

i have involved myself in numerous projects over the years - some going well, some going not so well. here are the ones that i think are cool enough to display here:

- [my website](https://squiggle.cf) | [its repository](https://github.com/tilda/web) - built using Vue.js and Tailwind.css, this is one of my favorite projects. i think it showcases who i am pretty nicely.
- [lolbot](https://github.com/lolbot-project/lolbot) - a Discord bot (currently in sunset phase) that aimed to bring some of my favorite APIs to Discord. built using discord.py, aiohttp, quart, and other fantastic libraries.
- ... (other future projects go here)

# contact

you can find all my contact methods on [my contact page](https://squiggle.cf/contact). i will make a best effort to respond to anything i receive (as long as it isn't spam)!
