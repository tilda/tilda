# greetings!

hi, i'm tilda, and welcome to my github profile! whether you're curious about me or just looking to get in touch, i've got you covered!

# about me

i'm a pretty young person who has been fascinated with computers and how they work from a young age. to the point where i have learned myself multiple programming languages including python and javascript, for backend and frontend usages. i take things as they come, and spend way too much time on projects to get things done.
